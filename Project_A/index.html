                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Strictly speaking, Arootexes do not have a community; rather, they function as different branches of
                    a singular whole. The classification of individuals is merely for human comprehension. These
                    seemingly independent entities appear to be closely connected, exchanging information and materials
                    through mechanisms that remain beyond our current understanding.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Arootex is scattered throughout the universe, settling in various corners. From a three-dimensional
                    perspective, the Arootex closest to humanity in physical distance resides in what was once referred
                    to as the companion galaxy of Andromeda. However, this is not its correct name. Early human
                    astronomers misidentified this location due to low-resolution observations, but three years ago,
                    advanced observational technology confirmed it as a genuine galaxy.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>As humanity has thus far observed only a single Arootex, the following descriptions will be based
                    solely on this specimen. From our current observational methods, Arootex exhibits a structure
                    reminiscent of a tree. Its form is composed of countless intertwining strands of green lasers,
                    arranged in a mathematically perfect and harmonious configuration. At its apex, a canopy-like
                    structure oscillates in a consistent and rhythmic manner. </p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Luminous, vast, and abstract form, unclassifiable as any known celestial body.</li>
                    <li>Continuous signal transmission.</li>
                    <li>Partial existence in higher dimensions.</li>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about [ Arootex ]?</span>
                Although further research and empirical validation are required, we have developed a preliminary
                understanding and hypotheses regarding the Arootex species. Their existence can be analogized to the
                World Tree in human mythology - an enigmatic and potentially dangerous phenomenon that cannot be fully
                explained through rational analysis alone. Arootex functions like the spreading roots of a world tree,
                migrating and settling throughout the universe to eventually grow into a new whole, thereby supporting
                the emergence of more complex cosmic structures. Communication is vital, as they exchange knowledge and
                information from the countless worlds they once passed by and rooted in. This increases their chances of
                rooting and allows them to reunite, giving rise to a new universe. They represent a tangible
                manifestation of the universe's entropy, contributing to chaos and the endless potential for
                transformation and evolution. Unfortunately, due to the insignificance of human time scales in
                comparison to theirs, we have yet to observe any activities or changes in Arootex beyond the
                fluctuations of their signal transmissions. As a result, it remains challenging to speculate on their
                energy sources or life cycle.<br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span>
                We have currently discovered a way to interact with Arootex. As is mentioned before, the top of Arootex
                is consistently releasing signals into the universe. Although the exact source of energy sustaining this
                movement remains undetermined, this motion might serve as a mean of transmitting signals to other
                distant termini, facilitating communication and interaction. Therefore, when we emit electrical signals
                containing different information into the surrounding universe, we observe that these signals rapidly
                converge toward the root of Arootex and ascend along its trunk, eventually disappearing, as though being
                absorbed by a gentler black hole. Once the signals enter the trunk, we notice subtle changes in the
                signals transmitted outward from the canopy, which contain elements of the information we sent. We
                hypothesize that through this interaction, Arootex is able to efficiently learn from our civilization
                and knowledge, subsequently sharing it with other individuals.
